Written explanation descibing the key learning points.


Write a short explanation (minimum 200 words) covering:
    The cases you handled for deletion.
    The logic behind choosing a replacement value for nodes with two children.
    Any challenges you faced while implementing deletion.


    In addition your bst.cpp should contain a main function that incorporates test cases demonstrating the correctness of your delete method. What does this mean? You should prove that your code works with an empty tree, a tree with one node, a tree with many nodes, a tree that has sequencial values in it (linked list), etc.. Think of every possible case and make sure your delete method works.
